// In the game of rock paper scissors both players make a "throw" of either 
// rock, paper or scissors, and the result of the game is decided with:
//
// rock beats scissors
// paper beats rock
// scissors beats paper
//
// all other states result in a draw, and the game is played again until there 
// is a winner.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

// Define preprocessor constants for ROCK, PAPER and SCISSORS which will 
// represent with the integers 1-3.  We'll randomly select an integer from 
// 1-3 to represent the "AI move".  Using these constants in our program also
// makes it easier to read than directly using 1,2,3.
#define ROCK 1
#define PAPER 2
#define SCISSORS 3

  // is executed.
